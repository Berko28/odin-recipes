This is a project where I will be building a basic recipe website.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have a fex links to a few recipes. Since this will be HTML only, I will not focus on css or styling the website to make it pretty.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate and use what I have learned so far, which will include links, lists, images, routing etc. plus working with Git.
